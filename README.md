Jeff, please create a file named `.env` in the root directory you can copy the contents from `.env-template.txt` and modify the values to match your system configuration.

Hope you like it!

To get started, clone this repo.

- run `npm i` on the root directory of the project
- run `npm run start`

The app is assuming that you have the database and expenses table created
